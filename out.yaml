    but with noticeably white throat and distinct scaling over crown, hindneck, and
    breast. Rather long decurved bill, pale eye, long, graduated and loose tail, and
    strong legs and\nfeet contribute to somewhat unattractive, scrawny, but arresting
    appearance.Sexes rather similar, no seasonal variation.\n\n\nHabitat.\nIn , lower
    warm arid latitudes of south-eastern fringe of W Palearctic, not only in lowlands
    but locally above 2000 m. Always in bushes or on ground, roosts in thick Acacia
    comes to water in evening, if available. In Oman and C Arabia, occurs in desert
    and in wadis with Acacia bushes, but requirement for Acacia seems not always to
    apply outside breeding season. In Israel does not penetrate to high elevations
    or to more humid northern regions, but will inhabit tamarisk clumps, salty swamps
    with reedbeds, gardens, vineyards, and even trees, and among houses. Prefers open
    terrain, shunning dense vegetation.\n\n\nFood and Feeding.\n\nWide variety of
    invertebrates, small vertebrates, plant material, and household scraps from garbage
    dumps. Birds usually forage in groups, on ground, bushes, and trees, variously
    digging in soil, turning over stones and leaves, stripping bark,\npecking at and
    prizing open branches, seed pods, and faeces.Groups have been seen killing warblers
    but unable to dismember them and left them intact.\n\n\nBreeding.\n\nFeb-Jul,
    peaking May-Jun in Israel, February onwards, more often Mar in Arabia and United
    Arab Emirates. Nest site, typically 1-7 m above ground inside cover, fork or crown
    of tree or bush.Nest large, untidy, fairly deep cup of coarse grasses, rootlets,
    bark, twigs, and other dead plant material, with no distinction between outer
    structure and lining, though may be lined with a few feathers ane animal hair.3-5

    has crown, hindneck and throat grass-green, very long streamers,\nup to 10 cm,
    and flavoviridis virtually identical to veridissimus\n, but throat can be yellow
    instead of green, perhaps dependent on plumage state.Race \ncleopatra less bronzy

    notes.\n\n13-14 cm, 15-22 g, wingspan 20-23 cm. Quite large and robust warbler,
    with rather long wings and legs but rather short tail. Essentially dusky-brown
    above, pale grey below, lacks white on tail-edges, and marked only by diagnostic
    short cap - black \non male, brownish on female and immature.Sexes dissimilar,
    no seasonal variation.\n\n\nHabitat.\nBreeds throughout middle latitudes of west
    Palearctic in temperate, boreal, and mediterranean climates, oceanic as well as
    continental. Highly arboreal, preferring to forage and sing in crowns of trees,
    often in more or less mature forest, although requiring also tall, not too dense
    shrubby undergrowth, especially for nesting.\n\n\nFood and Feeding.\nChiefly insects
    in breeding season, mainly plant material at other times. in breeding season,
    mainly picks insects from leaves and twigs, at heights of up to 20 m, not significantly
    different from feeding height of Garden Warbler.\n\n\nBreeding.\n\nMay-Jun in
    W and N-W Europe, May-Jul in Finland, Mid Apr to late Jul in S West Germany, mid
    Apr in S France, end Aug to end Nov in Cape Verde.Nest site, in low brambles,
    shrubs, and trees, on branch or among trunk suckers. Less often\nin creepers,
    tall herbs, or ferns.Nest, finely-constructed cup, often with transparent walls
    and or bottom, of grass and herb stems and leaves, plus rootlets and small twigs,
    bound together with spiders' webs and cocoons, lined with finer grasses,\nrootlets,
    and hair.4-6 eggs, sub-elliptical, smooth and glossy, very variable in ground-color
    and markings, mainly white or very pale buff, pink, or olive, with buff, brown,
    olive, red-brown, or purplish spots, speckles, and blotches.Incubation 10-16 days,

    and eastern birds wholly migratory, southern birds partially migratory, with most
    birds north of Mediterranean region leaving breeding area. 'leap-frog' migrant:
    northern populations move longest distance, reaching south of winter range, and
    populations further south apparently move progressively less far. Evidence from
    ringing recoveries, weight gain, and weights of grounded migrants suggests that
    progression is by a few long-distance movements.\n\n\nStatus and Conservation.\n\nNot

    notes.\n\n14 cm, 22-27 g, wingspan 25-26 cm. Medium-sized, elegant finch, with
    general character and behaviour of Chaffinch and rather similar basic plumage
    pattern but different, less varied colors in male.Both sexes show diagnostic combination
    of long, oval white rump and almost completely black tail. Male distinguished
    in breeding season by glossy black head and mantle, bordered by orange blaze from
    breast across shoulder and below back. In winter by black-speckled face and crown
    and black-splashed mantle.Female and juvenile distinguished by mottled dark brown
    head, with broad buff supercilium and grey sides to neck.Sexes dissimilar, marked
    seasonal variation in male.\n\n\nHabitat.\nBreeds across boreal and subarctic
    zones of west Palearctic. Owing to northerly range and arboreal requirements does
    not extend much up mountains, but is common on uplands in the more open birch
    woods, and in mixed forests of birch and conifers. Sometimes ranges beyond into
    lower growth of juniper, willow, or alder. Tall and dense stands in forest appear
    to be less favoured than open growth with clearings. Also found in riverine belts
    of willows.\n\n\nFood and Feeding.\nDiet based on seeds, berries, and invertebrates,
    especially Lepidoptera and beetles. In winter quarters specializes in beechnuts.
    On breeding grounds feeds mainly in trees, but other times mostly on ground,\ncommonly
    in flocks.\n\n\nBreeding.\n\nMid May to mid Jun in Finland, laying starts 2nd
    half of May in S, Jul in N Norway, late May to end of Jun in N-W RussIa, Jun -Jul
    in Scotland.Nest site, high in tree, often against trunk of conifer or in fork
    of deciduous tree.Nest, similar to that of Chaffinch but larger and more loosely
    built. Outer structure of moss, lichen, grass, heather, strips or juniper bark,
    and cobwebs, lined with feathers, moss, plant down, soft grass, hair, fur, and
    sometimes paper, string, etc.\n3-8 eggs, sub-elliptical, smooth an glossy. Very
    like those of Chaffinch, but greener, and with same wide variation, from clear
    light blue to dark olive-brown, with sparse to dense pink to rusty spots and blotches,
    and sometimes fine hair-streaks.Incubation, 11-12 days, by female only.\n\n\nMovements\n\nAll
    populations migratory, wintering almost entirely S of breeding range. European
    birds head between west and south, chiefly S-W. Extent of movement is strongly
    dependent on food availability. Local numbers wintering fluctuate greatly, and
    concentrations of millions of birds occur, especially in S-C Europe.Ringing data
    give evidence of winter site-fidelity, but also of individuals wintering in widely

    breeding in forest glades and clearings, as well as pine forests, tree plantations,
    forest steppe with birch trees, slopes of low mountains overgrown with grass and
    small pistachio trees, and orchards. Contrastingly, occurs freely in steep ravines,
    on bare alluvial deposits, and on rocky ground scantily covered with prickly shrubs.
    Favours regions of high sunshine and low rainfall, regardless of latitude, and

    voice. Breeding male instantly recognized by black head and bib and white collar,

    islands and peninsulas, and continental plains from arctic through boreal, temperate,
    and Mediterranean to steppe and even \ndesert climatic zones. Yet within this
    vast range, choice of occupied sites is ecologically restricted to particular
    types of dense and prolific fairly low vegetation, mainly associated with intense
    soil moisture. Avoids both closed forest and typical open country, as well as
    bare, rocky, or frozen surfaces, steep or broken ground, and areas of immediate
    human disturbance or settlement.\n\n\nFood and Feeding.\nseeds and other plant
    material, invertebrates in breeding season, and also opportunistically during
    remainder of year. Takes plant and animal material on ground among sedges, rushes,
    reeds, etc., in pasture and marshy grasslands, and also low in waterside bushes
    and trees willow, alder, or on stems of reed. Outside breeding season, more often
    on ground in open countryside and cultivated fields, weedy areas, woodland clearings,
    uplands, etc., well away from water, often in flocks with other seed-eaters. \n\n\nBreeding.\n\nMay-Jul
    in England, mid May to late Jun in Finland, Apr-Jul in Eastern Germany.Nest site,
    usually well hidden on ground or on sedge tussocks, heaps of dead rushes, reeds,
    etc., by water, also up to 4 m above ground.Nest, foundation of stems and blades
    of sedges, grasses, and other waterside plants, occasionally small twigs, lined
    with finer plant material, moss, rootlets, and sometimes hair or feathers.4-5
    eggs, sub-elliptical, smooth and slightly glossy. Very pale purplish, lilac-grey,
    or olive-brown, rarely buffish or greenish, with scrawls, spots, and blotches
    of purplish-brownish-black irregularly distributed over whole surface, or concentrated
    at either end. Incubation, 12-15 days, by female only.\n\n\n\nMovements\n\n\n
