18 cm, 40 g, wingspan 30-33 cm. Larger and much more robust than any other accentor. Quite strong billed, bulky, with
form somewhat recalling lark or pipit.<br>Plumage patterned as Hedge Accentor but more colorful, being basically dull 
blue-grey, with mottled brown back, white-edged black panel across forewing, white-speckled throat, rufous-splashed 
flanks, and white-tipped dark brown tail.<br>Sexes similar, little seasonal variation.
<br>

<font size="6" align="LEFT"><b>Habitat.</b></font>
<font size="5" align="LEFT"><br>
breeds exclusively in mountain ranges of middle latitudes, from 1800 m up to snow line, in some places up to 4000 m.<br>
Encounters accordingly low temperatures and exposed conditions, although apparently choosing sunniest available site.
Patches of alpine grassland strewn copiously with boulders or large stones, often on flat plateaux but sometimes on slopes
or scree, and almost always well above tree line and relatively free of shrub growth.
<br>

<font size="6" align="LEFT"><b>Food and Feeding.</b></font>
<font size="5" align="LEFT"><br>
Diet based on insects, plus significant proportion of plant seeds. Food taken principally on ground, bird moving with 
quick small hops or walking quietly.<br>Sometimes makes aerial sallies and will chase active prey on foot. Can hover for
short periods
<br>

<font size="6" align="LEFT"><b>Breeding.</b></font>
<font size="5" align="LEFT"><br>
May-Jul in Pyrenees and Alps. Nest site in crevice in cliff or rocks, or between boulders. Nest, loosely made of grass,
leaves and stems, with neat inner cup of moss lined with hair and feathers.<br>3-4 eggs, sub-elliptical, smooth and 
glossy, uniform pale blue. Incubation 14-15 days by both sexes.
<br>

<font size="6" align="LEFT"><b>Movements.</b></font>
<font size="5" align="LEFT"><br> 
Resident or subject to local altitudinal or more distant movements. Most descend in winter below snow line or seek 
snow-free patches.<br>Wintering in lowland southern Europe apparently wide spread though birds presumably sparsely 
distributed and occurrences perhaps irregular, but no details available.
<br>
 
<font size="6" align="LEFT"><b>Status and Conservation.</b></font>
<font size="5" align="LEFT"><br> 
Not globally threatened. No evidence of range changes.
